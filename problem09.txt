To find the total sales amount for each product using an INNER JOIN and the SUM() function, the query would be:

SELECT p.product_name, SUM(s.amount) AS total_sales
FROM Sales s 
INNER JOIN Products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name;

This query:

1. Joins the Sales and Products tables on the product_id column to connect the sales data with the product information.

2. Selects the product_name column from the Products table and calculates the SUM() of the amount column from the Sales table.

3. Groups the results by the product_name to get the total sales for each product.

The key steps are:

- Use INNER JOIN to only include sales data that has a matching product.
- Apply the SUM() function to the amount column to calculate the total sales for each product.
- Group the results by product_name to get the total for each product.
