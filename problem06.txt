To modify the `products` table to include the constraints you mentioned (making `product_id` a primary key and setting a default value of `50.00` for the `price` column), you can use the `ALTER TABLE` statement.

### Steps to Add the Constraints:

1. **Make `product_id` a Primary Key**: The `product_id` column should be the primary key, meaning each value in this column must be unique and not `NULL`.
2. **Set a Default Value for `price`**: The `price` column should automatically have a default value of `50.00` if no value is provided when inserting a new record.

Explanation:
- `ALTER TABLE products`: Specifies the table to modify.
- `ADD CONSTRAINT pk_product_id`: Adds a constraint called `pk_product_id` to the table.
- `PRIMARY KEY (product_id)`: Makes the `product_id` column the primary key.

Explanation:
- `ALTER TABLE products`: Specifies the table to modify.
- `ALTER COLUMN price`: Indicates that you are modifying the `price` column.
- `SET DEFAULT 50.00`: Sets the default value of the `price` column to `50.00`.

These SQL commands will:
- Ensure that the `product_id` is unique and non-null by making it the primary key.
- Ensure that the `price` will default to `50.00` when no value is provided during an insert operation.
