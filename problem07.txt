To fetch the student_name and class_name for each student using an INNER JOIN, the query would be:
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name, c.class_name
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN Classes c ON s.class_id = c.class_id;
This query joins the Students and Classes tables on the class_id column, allowing us to retrieve the student name and class name for each student record.
The key steps are:

Select the relevant columns from the Students (student_id, student_name) and Classes (class_name) tables.
Use the INNER JOIN clause to connect the two tables based on the shared class_id column.
This will return only the matching records where there is a corresponding entry in both the Students and Classes tables.

The result will be a table with the student ID, student name, and class name for each student.
