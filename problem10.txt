To display the order_id, customer_name, and the quantity of products ordered by each customer using an INNER JOIN between the three tables, the query would be:

SELECT 
    o.order_id,
    c.customer_name,
    od.quantity
FROM Orders o
INNER JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
INNER JOIN Order_Details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id;

This query:

1. Selects the order_id, customer_name, and quantity columns.
2. Joins the Orders, Customers, and Order_Details tables using INNER JOIN to connect the relevant data.
3. Matches the customer_id from the Orders table to the customer_id in the Customers table.
4. Matches the order_id from the Orders table to the order_id in the Order_Details table.
